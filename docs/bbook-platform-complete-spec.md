## SECTIONS YOU MISSED (Recommended Additions)

### User Side Missing:
1. **KYC Module** — Document upload (ID, address proof, selfie), verification status, reminder to complete before trading
2. **Demo Account** — Practice account with virtual funds, switch between demo/live
3. **Notifications Center** — In-app notification bell, push notifications, email alerts for margin call, SL hit, deposit confirmed, etc.
4. **Economic Calendar** — Built-in calendar showing upcoming events (NFP, FOMC, CPI) with impact ratings
5. **Multi-Account** — User can have multiple accounts (e.g., Standard, ECN, Cent) and switch between them
6. **Referral Rewards** — User-facing referral program (not just IB — casual "invite friends" with small rewards)

### Admin Side Missing:
7. **KYC Verification Queue** — Admin reviews uploaded documents, approve/reject with reason, auto-expiry reminders
8. **Risk Dashboard** — B-book specific: which users are profitable (admin is losing money on them), exposure per instrument, hedging alerts
9. **Instrument Management** — Add/remove instruments, set trading hours, set lot size constraints, enable/disable per segment
10. **Notification Management** — Configure automated notifications (margin call at 80%, stop-out at 50%, etc.), push notification campaigns
11. **Account Group Management** — Create account types (Standard, ECN, VIP, Demo, Islamic) with different leverage, spread, commission defaults
12. **Audit Log** — Full audit trail of every admin action, every trade modification, every fund adjustment — for compliance
13. **System Settings** — Global settings: default leverage, margin call level, stop-out level, max open trades per account, maintenance mode
14. **Report Scheduling** — Auto-generate daily P&L reports, weekly IB payouts, monthly statements — email to admin

### Critical for B-Book:
15. **Exposure Monitor** — Real-time view of admin's net exposure per instrument. If 100 users are long XAUUSD, admin is short — this dashboard shows that risk.
16. **Hedging Controls** — If exposure gets too high on one side, admin can choose to hedge externally (optional future feature)
17. **Price Manipulation Guard** — Logging system that tracks if/when admin-side spread changes affected active trades (compliance protection)
